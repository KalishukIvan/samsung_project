Main idea to separate 2 types of users: Bot and Human. Was made huge brainstorm on feature engeneering(especially
when we decided to understand who use our app - Human1 or Human2). 
Main modules:
  - Numpy
  - Scipy
  - Pandas (for collecting and work with data)
  - Sk-learn (work with classifiers and their combinations)
  - UMAP (isomaping of data vectors)
  - Matplotlib (visualisation)
Best results we get: 
  - 98% separation behavior of human from bot
  - 72% separation behavior of human1 from human2
